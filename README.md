# ***[Seamlessly](seamlessly.vincemaina.co.uk)***
## A web app that produces a "seamless" tile version of the input image â€” by performing basic mirror transformations.

[Click here](seamlessly.vincemaina.co.uk) to try it out

## How it works

The app doesn't do anything massively complex, and the quality of the output largely depends on what you feed into it.

The main use cases I see for this are as follows:

1. Creating a seamless textured background, particularly animated textures, like grain overlays.
1. Creating interesting patterns and kaleidoscope-like effects from both real-world images and computer-generated graphics.

Output file types are designed to be compatible with the css style attribute "background-image".


## How to get the best results

For this to work well, you need to use an input file that already has a fairly "uniform" texture. E.g. grain, scratches, crinkled paper etc. Any distincitive features in the image will stand out as they'll be mirrored and repeated across the page.)


## Feature requests

This was just a mini project, so won't be putting anymore time into it unless it generates some interest.

So if *have* stumbled across this app, and would like to see more features added (e.g. more accepted file types) please follow the project, and consider creating an issue [here](https://github.com/vchapandrews/seamlessly/issues) with your feature request.
